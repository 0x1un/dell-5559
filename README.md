# Dell Inspiron 5559

This repo for the 15" Dell Inspiron 5559 i5-6200U. It should work for the 17" model.

# Supported Versions

`config.plist` has a seperate version for Sierra/High Sierra and Mojave.

# How to use

The best way to use this EFI config is visit the [releases page](https://github.com/cbabb/dell-5559/releases). Create an empty `EFI` folder on the mounted EFI partition of the macOS disk. Drag both the `BOOT` and `CLOVER` folders into it. There are no serials present. You will need to generate it with Clover config.
